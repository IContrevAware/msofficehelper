  Helping people install MS Office. I DO NOT host any files of Microsoft so the USER must install all Microsoft files.  
  Not ALL Office Suites are included. Please check the code (myscript.bat) to see if your product is there.  

  Instructions: Download the .bat in a folder (E:\officehelp).  
  Now, go to: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspxid=49117].  
  Download the exe (in the folder we made).  
  Run it the .exe.  
  Now run the .bat as **Administrator**.  
  Enter office product.  
  Enter language (e.g en-gb or en-us).  
  Enter your apps you want (e.g Word,PowerPoint,Excel).  
  Choose Offline OR Online (I recommend online,).  
  Then, KABAM your pc is hacked.
